The British Embassy in Kabul operates under strict security protocols and staff receive regular security briefings to enable them to carry out their work in as safe an environment as possible.  </p>\n\n<p>Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in a hotel overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. </p>\n\n<p>Only travel with reputable local guides and to fully protected workplaces. Take the utmost care and vary your routines. If possible maintain radio or telephone communications to report your movements. Avoid any protests, demonstrations or large gatherings.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-afghanistan\">Northern Afghanistan</h3>\n<p>There have been a number of attacks against aid workers and military vehicles resulting in deaths and injuries, and there are ongoing military operations throughout the north. The FCO advice against all travel to Badakhshan includes travel to or climbing and trekking within the Wakhan Corridor. This is due to the significant security risks in the region and the Wakhan Corridor&rsquo;s geographical isolation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eastern-afghanistan\">Eastern Afghanistan</h3>\n<p>The eastern region has been extremely volatile for some time, with almost daily suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks. The region close to the Pakistani border is extremely dangerous with a high number of insurgents operating freely.</p>\n\n<p>There are regular, large military operations in this region. There have been numerous daily attacks against the Security Forces and US-led coalition forces. There are also daily incidents of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), suicide and rocket attacks, and direct fire attacks on security forces patrols, checkpoints and bases as well as on the local population.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"southern-afghanistan\">Southern Afghanistan</h3>\n<p>The southern region is unpredictable and extremely volatile. There are regular military operations throughout the region and there has been a significant increase in the number of incidents ranging from shootings and roadside bombs to suicide bombings that have targeted civilians and the military. Suicide and roadside bomb attacks in Helmand, Kandahar and Nimroz continue.</p>\n\n<p>There has been a series of attacks on the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat road in Zabul, Kandahar, Helmand, Nimroz (and Farah) provinces and in Uruzgan province. Nimroz has seen an increasing number of suicide attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"western-afghanistan\">Western Afghanistan</h3>\n<p>There have been roadside bombs, suicide attacks, rocket attacks and criminal kidnappings throughout the western provinces and increased lawlessness in Western Ghor. There is little security infrastructure in Dai Kundi and westerners have been kidnapped there.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n<p>Road travel is highly dangerous. Insurgents have set up false vehicle checkpoints from which violent attacks have been launched. In addition to the threat from terrorism and kidnapping, there is also a continuing criminal threat from car-jacking and robbery.  </p>\n\n<p>If you travel by road you should only travel in secure transport with close protection, using reputable local drivers and guides. Make sure doors are locked and windows closed. In many areas you should consider the use of armoured vehicles. Most road surfaces are in a very poor condition. The overall standard of driving is poor and most local drivers are uninsured. Accidents may lead to confrontation and threatening behaviour.  </p>\n\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan/terrorism\">Terrorism section</a> for information on threats to road travel within Kabul. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"non-governmental-organisations-ngos\">Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)</h3>\n<p>There have been a number of serious attacks on both western and Afghan NGOs and vehicles belonging to them, in which people have been killed or injured. Most attacks continue to occur in the east and south of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) www.ngosafety.org issues regular security updates for NGOs.</p>\n\n<p>There have been two recent reports of sexual assault against females from EU countries working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Kabul.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n<p>All airlines from Afghanistan have been refused permission to operate services to the EU because Afghanistan is unable to ensure that its airlines meet international safety standards.  </p>\n\n<p>A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20121127-0\">Aviation Safety network.</a> We can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/Pages/index.aspx\">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>\n\n<p>You should avoid flying with airlines subject to the EU operating ban. FCO staff are advised to use carriers which are not subject to the EU operating ban.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transiting-uae\">Transiting UAE</h3>\n<p>Flying to Dubai and then transferring is the most common route into Afghanistan. It is illegal to transit the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates\">United Arab Emirates</a> carrying unlicensed personal protection equipment. This includes, but is not limited to, body armour (including ballistic vests), weapon holsters and handcuffs. Other specialist technical equipment such as satellite phones, listening and recording devices, powerful cameras and binoculars, while freely available in the UK, may also require licenses. Persons found carrying any such items without a license may be subject to conviction resulting in imprisonment and substantial monetary fines in accordance with Emirati law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Crime is a serious concern, particularly in rural areas. Foreigners have been the victims of violent attacks, including armed robbery and rape.  Don’t display any obvious signs of wealth, or carry large sums of money. Don’t travel alone, especially on foot. Take particular care after dark.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h3>\n\n<p>Afghanistan is undergoing a major transition in terms of politics, economy and security. Avoid large public gatherings and follow the local media for information on the security situation. It is difficult to categorise the country as a whole due to its diverse geography, ethnic, tribal and religious differences, and the ongoing insurgency. Large parts of the east, south east and south of the country are affected by conflict. Other areas have seen steady improvements in security, but are still prone to terrorist attacks and a high crime rate.</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>There is a high threat from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">terrorism.</a> Multiple threats are issued daily.  Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), domestic and international political and civilian targets, and those working in the humanitarian and reconstruction fields. There is a threat from high-profile, large-scale attacks in Kabul. </p>\n\n<p>Afghanistan-focused insurgents seek the full withdrawal of foreign forces in Afghanistan and the fall of the elected Afghan government. Other groups involved in the insurgency include the Haqqani Network, an Islamist insurgent group whose main goal is to re-establish sharia law in Afghanistan, and are allied with the Taliban. </p>\n\n<p>The insurgency has a strong anti-Western focus; this could make any UK interest or person a target. Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime.</p>\n\n<p>There are large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>You should be particularly vigilant in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels used by the government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are possible. Avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested. The British Embassy does not allow official visitors to stay in any hotel overnight, and has placed restaurants off limits to staff. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling in Kabul, take particular care on Airport road, Jalalabad road and Darulaman road. Avoid travelling on Jalalabad and Darulaman roads during commuter or other busy times (around 6am to 8am, 9am to 11am and 3pm to 4pm local time), when traffic can be heaviest and the risk of an attack against government and western people or interests is most likely. Avoid travel between cities at night time. Avoid travelling along Airport road except for essential movements as attacks are likely throughout the day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnap\">Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a very high and constant threat. Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan in the last 10 years, a number of them have been British nationals in Badakhshan, Bamyan, Kunar, Kunduz and near the border with Pakistan but the kidnap threat is not isolated to these areas. The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country. Outside Kabul you should consider the use of permanent armed protection and armoured vehicles. </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n\n<p>There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.</p>\n"
